# leetcode-journey
Code and notes repository for my leetcode journey

## Study plan
1. Study data structures part 1
   - Arrays
     - [array problems](https://leetcode.com/problem-list/array/)
   - Linked lists
     - [linked list problems](https://leetcode.com/problem-list/linked-list/)
   - Maps
     - [hash table problems](https://leetcode.com/problem-list/hash-table/)
   - Know the time complexity and space complexity of each
   - Do three problems for each category
2. Study data structures part 2
   - Searching algorithms
     - binary search
       - [binary search problems](https://leetcode.com/problem-list/binary-search/)
     - linear search
   - Sorting algorithms
     - quicksort
   - Trees
     - pre, in, and post traversals for binary trees
   - Know the time complexity and space complexity of each
   - Do a few problems for each category
3. Do the first 1-50 problems in order

### Other sets of problems to do
- Blind 75
  - The 75 problems are specifically chosen because they cover the most fundamental and frequently asked data structures and algorithmic patterns in technical coding interviews for software engineering roles

## Notes:
- Do NOT spend longer than 40 minutes on a problem (start a timer when I start the problem)
